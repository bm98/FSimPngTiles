README for the bm98ch/fsimtileserver configuration file
fsimtileserver is implementing a tilelive/tessera tile server
see: https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive

Name: tessera-cfg.json
Location: the ./tiles folder of the server path

Place your tiles in a subfolder of this directory
e.g. PNGmap rsp. OTHERmap  for this example
PNGmap would contain the z/x/y.jpg   raster tiles
OTHERmap would contain  z/x/y.png   raster tiles

The configuration file must conform to JSON specs (snip below)
see: https://github.com/mojodna/tessera

You define server routes  /ROUTE  and the corresponding tilelive source.
The route is the http path to get the tiles from
Only the file system module is installed i.e. can only serve from the local disk
see: https://github.com/mapbox/tilelive-file

There can be multiple tile sets defined 

Each one starts as:
"/ROUTE" : { ... }
"sources": "file://./tiles/MapFolder[/?filetype=jpg]"  
   defines the source protocol (file://) and the path where the tiles will be found it is ./tiles/Tiledirectory
Note: the optional query parameter ?/filetype=jpg  is required if tiles are NOT of .png type
Nowhere documented but the tilelive-file module seems to be sensitive to this one... (visit the source code)

The two config options tell tessera to not use cors and timing for that route

For the example below one could access the PNG tiles with either 
   http://Host:8081/{z}/{x}/{y.jpg}
but also with 
   http://Host:8081/PNG/{z}/{x}/{y.jpg}
Using 
   http://Host:8081/OTHER/{z}/{x}/{y.png}  would serve tiles from the folder OTHERmap as .png files

Note: the folder where the tiles are located requires the presence of the metadata.json file 
See also metadata.json.readme.txt about how and what
